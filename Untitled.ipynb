      "In a bench study testing the performance of several brands of ventilators with the Passy Muir Valve in-line, all ventilators in the study focused satisfactorily with restrictions on certain modes and alarm settings.\n",
      "Multidisciplinary teams that incorporate the Valve as a routine strategy in ventilator weaning have improved outcomes.4-7\n",
      "Reduce or eliminate PEEP: The establishment of a closed respiratory system and exhalation through the oronasopharynx, creates physiologic PEEP. This enables the clinician to reduce/eliminate set mechanical PEEP. This adjustment may also eliminate any unnecessary continuous airflow within the circuit. Continuous flow in the circuit may make it difficult for the patient to close his vocal cords and may stimulate continuous coughing and autocycling of the ventilator.\n",
      "Volume Compensation: For patients with inspiratory volume loss, after cuff deflation, additional tidal volume can be added until adequate voicing can be heard, good chest expansion is noted, or baseline peak inspiratory pressure is reached. This assures adequate alveolar ventilation with the cuff deflated. An increase in delivered tidal volume may be a temporary adjustment until strength of the pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles is regained. NOTE: 400cc is the maximum recommended additional volume.\n",
      "Alarm Adjustments: All alarms on the ventilator must be re-evaluated for appropriate adjustments before, during, and after use of the Valve. Since exhaled volumes are not returned to the ventilator, some alarms can be adjusted or silenced to stop unnecessary alarming. The high and low pressure alarms should remain intact and adjusted appropriately to detect and alert caregivers to disconnects, patient fatigue, or changes in peak airway pressures.\n",

      "Ventilators are life-saving devices that provide respiratory support in situations where a patient needs help breathing, outside of a hospital. Due to the portability of many of these devices, life-saving oxygen can be supplied quickly and efficiently while the patient is being tended to or transported. \n",
      "Ventilation devices include a control system, a flexible breathing circuit, and some sort of monitor or alarm system for monitoring vitals. The Allied Healthcare AHP300 is a very capable ventilator that has quick-start ventilation enabled, an extended battery life, and a conservation mode to keep oxygen reserves supplied as long as possible, until the patient reaches the emergency room. \n",
      "Ventilators not only need to provide oxygen, but also must be tough for rugged emergency conditions. The Allied Healthcare AHP300 is one such device, complete with shock and vibration-resistant frame and IPX22 water resistance levels.\n",
      "If you’re searching for an even smaller transport ventilator, Allied Healthcare also offers the AutoVent 2000 and AutoVent 3000 Automatic Transport Ventilators. These handheld devices provide a flow up to 48 lpm, with a supply pressure between 40 - 60 psig. It’s lightweight and compact, making it easy to pack and carry in an emergency. \n",
      "The ventilation devices themselves are just one part of the cycle needed to give patients continuous oxygen. Other accessories that are needed include oxygen hoses, carrying cases, handles and wall mounts. Allied Healthcare also offers compatible oxygen regulators to keep oxygen flow at the appropriate level for patients of different ages or circumstances.\n",
      "Carrying cases and wall mounts can be used to safely store the ventilator or for grab-and-go. Carrying cases give access to the controls and valves of the ventilator while protecting the device from dust, dirt, and water. For internal clinical use, a roller stand mount can secure the ventilator and store accessories underneath, all on a convenient rolling stand. Wall mounts keep the device elevated and away from other vital equipment, often with easy removal and placement design.\n",

      "No matter how dedicated, nursing   staff cannot be everywhere at once.  This is where our wireless MicroVision and Vision Link systems can help.  They use 900 MHz spread   spectrum wireless technology to link your patients to your staff 24 hours a   day.  When a monitored ventilator, IV pump or other device goes into   alarm, the patient name, room number and other information is wirelessly   transmitted to the console at the nursing station and to pocket pagers or   other notification devices carried by your nursing staff.  \n",
      "Prevent Ventilator Alarm Fatigue    Each alarm transmitter has event timer that allows you to set the number of seconds   between the ventilator’s initial alarm and when the event is wirelessly   transmitted to nursing staff. This helps reduce nuisance alarms that   contribute to ventilator alarm fatigue.  \n",
      "User Friendly    Our systems arrive   pre-programmed for your use and are very easy to install. Just plug the   transmitter into the alarm output on the ventilator, plug the console into an   electrical outlet at the nursing station and it's ready to go. Not at the   console? No problem. Caregivers can be equipped with optional pocket pagers   or other wireless device for alarm call notification. Each alarm call can   vibrate or tone to annunciate the call and the display will show the room   number or name associated with the device.  \n",

      "The Neo-Pod™ “T” Neonatal Transport Humidification System, with improved LavaBed™ humidifier cartridge is designed to deliver heated and humidified breathing gases during transports of infants receiving mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, or CPAP.\n",
      "The Neo-Pod “T” maintains proper conditioning of inspiratory gas during brief as well as lengthy transport situations to help maintain the infant’s neutral thermal environment and prevent inspissation of airway secretions. Adequate inspired gas temperatures are associated with a lower incidence of pneumothorax and a decreased severity of chronic lung disease in ventilated very low birth weight infants. Mechanical ventilation during transport, even bagging, without humidification, can result in heat loss through the lungs, making proper thermoregulation more difficult.\n",
      "Inspired by the unique needs of the neonatal transport team and their patients, the Neo-Pod “T” is the first disposable active humidification device designed to operate with virtually all ventilation/incubation systems used in neonatal transport. Compact, lightweight and energy efficient, the Neo-Pod “T” provides the proper heat and humidification of inspiratory gas to help maintain patient body temperature, while preventing drying of airway secretions during mechanical ventilation, nCPAP, or when using high flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery. \n",
      "The Neo-Pod “T” is simple to set-up and easy-to-use. The one-way Quick Connect Power Cable makes insertion and removal effortless. Plus, the Cartridge Bracket design lets you slip on the disposable LavaBed™ humidifier cartridge in seconds. You can adjust and monitor the temperature of the LavaBed cartridge between 30 ̊C – 38 ̊C. The proven, pass-through humidification design ensures that completely saturated gas is provided to the patient. The internal LavaBed temperature sensor actively monitors temperature. For added safety, a proximal airway temperature sensor enables continuous temperature measurement of the delivered gas at the patient interface. \n",
      "Here’s how the Neo-Pod “T” works. Dry gas from the flow meter, blender or ventilator flows through the system’s circuit to the LavaBed humidifier cartridge, where the gas is warmed and humidified. The humidified gas is then directed to the infant through the ventilator circuit, nasal cannula or CPAP setup. Both the internal LavaBed temperature sensor and proximal airway sensor measure the temperature of the delivered gas and feed the signal to the Control Unit for automatic maintenance of the desired temperature.\n",
      "The LavaBed Humidifier Cartridge holds approximately 20 mL of sterile water and is filled with a simple syringe, rather than the cumbersome water-feed system found in other devices. An overflow port automatically prevents over-filling. The LavaBed Humidifier Cartridge is secured inside the transport incubator, which enables the benefits of shorter tubing lengths and virtually eliminates the issues associated with varying temperature gradients that may lead to tubing condensation.\n",
      "Low admission temperatures in preterm infants have been associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality1. In 2010, tePas and associates concluded that the use of heated and humidified air during respiratory support in very preterm infants just after birth reduced the post-natal decrease in temperature.2   In 2015, Meyer and colleagues assessed whether admission temperature of preterm infants would be improved by the application of heated and humidified gas at delivery and while awaiting transport to NICU. Adding heated humidified gas resulted in preterm infants from birth achieving higher rates of normothermia at admission. Humidification was also more effective in preventing more severe degrees of hypothermia.1\n",
      "References:1. Meyer MP, Hou D, Ishrar NN, et al. Initial respiratory support with cold, dry gas versus heated humidified gas and admission temperature of preterm infants. J Pediatr 2015; 166: 245-250.2.  tePas AB, Lopriore E, Dito I, et al. Humidified and heated air during stabilization at birth improves temperature in preterm infants. Pediatrics 2010; 125: e1427-e1432.\n",
      "The Neo-Pod “T” is a complete system that includes ventilator circuits, high flow circuits, water feed syringe and extension tubing, various sizes of infant high flow nasal cannulas and the PressureSafe™ Neonatal High Flow Nasal Cannula with integral Pressure Relief Valve for protection against inadvertent airway pressure spikes.\n",

      "The LAV-3000 is designed as a reliable, efficient, and effective large animal ventilator that readily connects to any existing anesthesia machine by removing the reservoir bag and connecting the interface hose in its place. The bellows of the LAV-3000 will now replace the function of the reservoir bag and act as a sensing device for the modified Mark 7 Servo.\n",
      "Just like all of the other anesthesia equipment and ventilators manufactured by JD Medical, the LAV-3000 does not require any electric power. This means that not only is the machine a more environmentally-conscious choice, but the machine is also not bound by electrical outlets or power cords and when used with the optional E-cylinder mounting bracket, the LAV-3000 can be used almost anywhere.\n",
      "The LAV-3000 allows the clinician to fully ventilate the patient. The ventilator is a pneumatic device that automatically pressurizes the space between the bellows and the canister forcing the bellows in an upward motion delivering anesthetic gases from the bellows through the interface hose.\n",
      "The LAV-3000 is designed for facilities that currently use a passive anesthesia machine and wish to expand their capabilities to include full ventilation of their patients. The LAV-3000 provides a fantastic cost-saving option for facilities that wish to continue using their current passive anesthesia machine but wish to be able to ventilate as well. Rather than forcing these facilities to purchase more expensive complete anesthesia machine/ventilator units, JD Medical decided over 25 years ago that another option was necessary and the LAV-3000 was, and still is, the answer. The LAV-3000 is built on the same rigid stainless steel platform as the LAVC-2000 series anesthesia machines. It is an incredibly simple and user-friendly machine that is also rugged and reliable.\n",

      "As the U.S. and the rest of the world scramble desperately to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals are faced with a critical shortage of ventilators, the bedside devices that help patients who have difficulty breathing on their own.\n",
      "U.S. hospitals have about 160,000 ventilators, with another 12,700 available from the federal government's National Strategic Stockpile, the New York Times reported March 18, 2020. But it's feared that will be nowhere near enough to cope with all the people who could become seriously ill from the virus.\n",
      "All this has suddenly focused attention on a piece of medical equipment that most of us probably haven't given much thought to, any more than we think about breathing itself. But for someone who can't get air into his or her lungs, the device — which ranges in price from $25,000 to $50,000, according to the Washington Post — can be a lifesaver.\n",
      "Ventilators assist patients with a number of different conditions. \"They can be used to help people breath during routine surgery under anesthesia or also when patients are sick and have difficulty breathing due to their illness,\" explains Dr. Paul F. Currier, director of the Respiratory Acute Care Unit for the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital, via email. A small proportion of people who become infected with COVID-19 may develop inflammation in their lungs. \"An even smaller proportion of these patients can develop respiratory failure which is best treated with a ventilator.\"\n",
      "\"Think of the lungs as an elastic balloon,\" Kenneth Lutchen, dean of the College of Engineering and a professor of biomedical engineering at Boston University (BU), says via email. \"You can expand the balloon by having the pressure at the opening (mouth) be greater than the pressure on the other side of it. Normally we breath by having our muscles expand the chest which lowers the pressure around the lungs inside the body so that the lungs expand.\n",
      "\"But if the lungs fill up with fluid or become highly inflamed — both of which can happen in coronavirus — then the negative pressures that occur with normal breathing are not sufficient to expand the lungs enough and insufficient O2 and CO2 exchange will result,\" Lutchen continues. \"The alternative is then to 'push' air into the lungs using a ventilator which creates a positive pressure at the mouth — the inlet to the intubation tube — large enough to push enough fresh air in and out each breath. Hopefully, this can keep the blood O2 and CO2 levels close to normal until the inflammation and fluid buildup subsides and the person can breathe on their own again.\"\n",
      "The boxy mechanical device with a digital display on the top typically sits on a cart next to the bed. As the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute website explains, the patient is connected to the device by a breathing tube that's inserted through his or her nose or mouth down the throat, which is held in place by tape or a strap that fits around the head. The tube in the airway can cause some discomfort, and also affects a patient's ability to talk or eat. That's why the care team may insert another tube into a vein to feed the patient nutrients, or — if the person is going to be on a ventilator for a long time — insert a nasogastric feeding tube that goes directly into the stomach or small intestine through a surgically created opening.\n",
      "Having a tube down your throat isn't exactly pleasant, but it's important. \"Without intubation several things can threaten the ability of the ventilator to do its job,\" Lutchen explains. \"Perhaps the most important is that if the ventilator just blew into the mouth the delivered volume may not all go into the lung. Some of it could leak out the nose — which is connected to the mouth — or some can end up expanding the cheeks of the person rather than going into the lung.\"\n",
      "To get this all to work, hospitals depend upon the expertise of highly trained professionals called respiratory therapists. \"The respiratory therapist determines the appropriate settings to match the patient's respiratory needs based on the underlying disease condition,\" explains Timothy R. Myers, a respiratory therapist and chief business officer of the American Association for Respiratory Care, by email. \"From that point, they provide constant monitoring and assessment and modify the setting as the patient's condition improves or worsens. This would include noninvasive monitoring and measurements from blood analysis to look at oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.\"\n",
      "This requires a lot of careful management, because lungs are pretty complicated, Myers explains. While it's useful to think of the lungs as a balloon for illustrative purposes, in reality, they're \"more like a network of millions of balloons that must transfer gases between the lungs and the circulatory system. When the lungs are damaged or diseased, each lung and the millions of balloons require gas entry in and out differently than when healthy. Each patient is unique.\"\n",
      "In recent years, there have been some advances in how ventilators are used. \"Research has shown that using low breath size and low pressures improves outcomes,\" Currier explains. \"Also, patients with severe respiratory failure may at times be turned on their stomachs while on the ventilator, a process called prone positioning, which can often improve their oxygen levels. Finally, for some patients whose oxygen levels remain low despite being on a ventilator, they may be able to receive Extra-Corporeal Membranous Oxygenation (ECMO) in some very specialized centers. This highly intensive therapy can circulate the blood outside of the body to provide additional oxygen.\"\n",
      "Lutchen's research focuses upon  developing safer mechanical ventilators. \"Initially the ventilator is working to save a life by keeping proper O2 and CO2 levels,\" he says. \"But it does this by pushing air in and exposing the lung to abnormal pressures, often larger pressures to help expand a stiffer and/or narrower lung. Also a ventilator is programmed to give the exact same breath every time where normal breathing varies a little from breath to breath and we periodically take a big breath. If you need to be on a ventilator for a very long time there is a risk of the repetitive large pressures to cause Ventilator Induced Lung Injury (VILI) which could facilitate Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Now the ventilator may no longer be able to provide enough O2 and CO2 exchange.\"\n",
      "That's why Lutchen is working with lead investigator Bela Suki, a professor of biomedical engineering at BU, on a concept called variable ventilation, in which the ventilator delivers variable breaths similar to a natural breathing pattern, to avoid repetitive abnormal pressures in the same location when a person breathes. \"There is some evidence in animals that this approach is less likely to lead to VILI and can facilitate recovery from ARDS,\" Lutchen says. \"But the approach has not yet been tested in humans.\"\n",
      "With the current shortage of ventilators, manufacturers are ramping up production. Medtronic, one of the world's major ventilator makers, is gearing up to double its output, by adding shifts to keep its Irish manufacturing plant running around the clock, a Medtronic company representative wrote to HowStuffWorks.\n",
      "But manufacturers face a challenge in increasing production, because ventilators must be built with great care. \"As these are live-saving devices, very high standard in terms of quality assurance apply,\" Swiss-based manufacturer Hamilton Medical AG says via email.\n",

      "Med-Vet International carries a wide selection of anesthesia and respiratory equipment. You can browse through a variety of anesthesia machines and parts.  An anesthesia machine prepares a gas mixture that is delivered to a breathing system and delivers this gas mixture to patients undergoing surgery. You can find both humidifiers and vaporizers here. Water is removed from medical gases and external humidifiers compensate for the lack of humidity when a patient is breathing in gases. Humidification during anesthesia is very important. It prevents adverse changes in airways and possible pulmonary damage. A vaporizer is typically attached to an anesthesia machine. It controls the vaporization of anesthetic agents from liquid and controls the concentration in which these agents are added to the gas flow. Find cylinder tanks for oxygen therapy. Oxygen tanks are medical devices used to deliver and regulate supplemental oxygen to a person that does not get enough oxygen. Find accessories and carrying devices for these tanks here as well. A scavenger is used to gather and remove gases from the patients breathing circuit or ventilation circuit. A ventilator is a machine that helps patients breath who cannot breath on their own. It is often used for short periods such as during surgery. Ventilators blow air into airways and lungs. Buy your anesthesia and respiratory equipment and accessories here! \n",

      "After a successful intubation, your patient is mechanically ventilated with a patent airway and his vital signs stabilize. While transporting your patient, you notice a sawtooth pattern to the ventilator waveform. The patient’s cough is not “junky” and his oxygen saturation remains stable. You may be thinking your patient needs some sedation to help him synchronize with the ventilator. But hold on—perhaps you are missing something.\n",
      " \n",
      "You are already well aware that a patient who is mechanically ventilated and has coarse breath sounds and visible secretions requires inline tracheal suctioning. It is probably second nature by now for you to associate one with the other. But are you comfortable recognizing the less obvious signs that your mechanically ventilated patient needs suctioning? Let’s explore a few of these and how you can better recognize them the next time you encounter them.\n",
      "One sign that indicates your patient likely requires suctioning is volume changes on the ventilator. In pressure control ventilation (PCV), pressure is the controlled parameter and time is the signal that ends inspiration, with the delivered tidal volume determined by these parameters. Because pressure is set in this type of ventilation, decreases in tidal volume in PCV may indicate the need for suctioning.\n",
      " \n",
      "If you are monitoring your patient on PCV and notice a decrease in delivered tidal volumes, this should make you think that the patient may need suctioning.\n",
      " hbspt.cta._relativeUrls=true;hbspt.cta.load(212347, 'c51b1d70-e422-4d18-a04f-886a3c25d82f', {}); \n",
      " \n",
      "A pressure change on the ventilator, specifically peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), is a classic indicator that your patient may need suctioning. When your patient is placed in a volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) setting on the ventilator, volume is the controlled parameter, and the pressure in which it takes to deliver that set volume will change. Because pressure is the variable, any change in peak inspiratory pressure indicates that it is taking more pressure to achieve the tidal volume set for your patient—which may be caused by secretions within the airway.\n",
      "Increases in PIP may not necessarily indicate secretions in the patient’s airway; they could indicate other serious conditions, such as pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Look for these elevations (above 30 cmH20) and assess your patient to determine the need for suctioning. Keep your ventilator patient safe by ensuring your pressure alarms are always within your facility’s parameters and set accordingly.\n",
      "Learning basic waveforms and their meaning will benefit you and your work in the field. Specifically, understanding pressure-volume loops and what these look like on your ventilators is very helpful. An over-distension of this type of loop is the classic “duck bill” appearance and indicates a large increase in pressure without an increase in tidal volume. In other words, the ventilator is working harder to push the air into your patient’s lungs without achieving the volume it is trying to achieve. What may be causing this pressure? You guessed it—secretions, obstructions, or anatomical changes to the patient’s airway.\n",
      " \n",
      "Monitoring the patient’s waveforms on the ventilator will clue you into whether or not the patient may need suctioning.\n",
      "You know what we are talking about here—alarms are sounding and the patient looks uncomfortable and is asynchronous with the ventilator. This patient may very well need deep sedation or a neuromuscular blockade agent in order to achieve adequate ventilation. However, you should always begin with assessing your patient. Does your patient have retained secretions that your portable suction unit can remove? Even if that only minimizes the patient’s ventilation issues, it’s a start to getting your patient where you want them to be.\n",
      "Remember that patient you were transporting? He may have needed deep sedation or even a neuromuscular blocking agent to improve his synchronicity with the ventilator. But perhaps a deeper dive into your respiratory assessment would have revealed that he needed tracheal suctioning more than he needed sedation. Understanding both the obvious and subtle signs your patient needs suctioning is a priority when caring for patients on mechanical ventilators. Learning the basics about the types of mechanical ventilation, basic waveform formation, and signs of asynchronicity with mechanical ventilation will help you recognize these signs in your patients in the future and determine whether or not they need suctioning.\n",

      "When you have a chronic respiratory condition or a serious acute respiratory illness, having a ventilator for home is a must. A ventilator is a machine that delivers either room air or oxygen-enriched air into a breathing circuit, which humidifies the air to help with treating conditions like emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis and pneumonia, among others. This is beneficial for patients who are struggling to breathe normally and need supplemental oxygen, but are not in need of a more complex critical-care ventilator. Portable ventilators are easy to transport and operate.Oxycare Plus, Inc., is your eastern Mississippi dealer, with locations in Columbus and Tupelo, as well as one location in Northport, Alabama. Here are a few types of ventilators that we carry.\n",
      "The Trilogy line of portable ventilators is the most widely distributed ventilator for home in North America. This ventilator provides AVAPS-AE, which is non-invasive auto-titrating ventilation that is designed to adjust to the patient’s breathing patterns and provide them with the lowest effective pressure for maximum comfort. The Auto Backup algorithm delays the machine breath until the patient has fully exhaled to reduce air trapping. Trilogy ventilators are easy to use and help to make treatment less complex for respiratory patients.\n",
      "The Stellar™ 150 ventilator can perform both invasive and non-invasive ventilation in a home or healthcare setting. This machine uses iVAPS™ (intelligent volume-assured pressure support) to adjust to the patient’s breathing patterns. The Stellar portable ventilator is simple to operate and has an easy-to-read display panel.The Astral™ 150 weighs just over 7 pounds and has internal and external batteries that give it a run-time of 24 hours. This allows for more patient freedom, since they can easily take the Astral portable ventilator with them during the day to use when needed. The machine’s intuitive interface and presettable programs make for a quick and accurate set-up.\n",

      "Voxello’s mission directly addresses the communication barriers in the ICU that the Covid19 pandemic has brought to everyone’s attention (www.voxello.com).\n",
      " \n",
      "Imagine yourself waking up in an intensive care unit and on a ventilator. You feel awful and because you are hooked up to a ventilator you are unable to speak. You are alone as your family and friends are not permitted into the hospital because of  Covid19 precautions. You are surrounded by doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists who are wearing masks and other protective equipment that makes it difficult for you to hear and understand what they are telling you. You have lots of questions about your condition. You want to have a role in critical medical decision making. You want to communicate with your family and know how they are doing. You are scared and not being able to speak and effectively communicate with your healthcare providers is not only stressful but also impacts the care they can provide.\n",
      " \n",
      "When patients are unable to communicate they are at a heightened risk of experiencing preventable adverse medical outcomes. It is essential that a patient be able to communicate that they are in pain or experiencing a novel symptom if we hope to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, pressure sores, and adverse reactions to medications or blood products. Measures of heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen levels can tell us a lot about a patient’s state, but they cannot necessarily tell us what the source of the patient’s distress is. If a patient is agitated we naturally assume that it is related to the condition that landed them in the ICU.\n",
      " \n",
      "We had an elderly patient at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics who was intubated and on a ventilator in our ICU and was very agitated about something. The nurses tried to get the patient to write out what was bothering her, but her handwriting was illegible, so they began to ask her a series of yes/no questions. Was she in pain? Was she worried about her condition? This went on for a considerable amount of time and they were not getting any closer to figuring out what was bothering her. By happenstance, they landed up asking the patient some random questions totally unrelated to the condition that brought her to the hospital. It turned out that what she was so worried about was that she had taken some chicken out of the freezer and was worried that it was on her kitchen counter and would spoil. Throughout this whole process, the patient’s anxiety continued to increase to the point that the staff was considering having to sedate the patient. The minute the staff figured out what the patient was worried about and could address that, the patient’s anxiety was alleviated without medical intervention.\n",
      " \n",
      "Colleagues working with a patient at the University of Wisconsin reported on a patient who was on a ventilator and would need to stay on the ventilator and so would need a tracheostomy. In order to get consent for the procedure, the medical staff was communicating with the patient by asking him yes/no questions. He repeatedly seemed to indicate that he did not want to have a tracheostomy. Luckily a speech-language pathologist was called in and provided the patient with some communication tools that would allow the patient to ask questions. It turned out that the patient definitely did want to be maintained on the ventilator.  What he had been indicating in response to the yes/no questions was that he did not want to be awake during the procedure. Absent the intervention by the speech-language pathologist his initial responses would have been interpreted to mean that he wanted to be withdrawn from life support.\n",
      " \n",
      "In spite of all the amazing advances in medicine, effective communication between the patient and health care providers remains a key to positive outcomes. We know that patients who are critically ill and in ICUs face significant barriers to communication. Covid19 precautions have only exacerbated the impact of such barriers. Being on mechanical ventilation makes it impossible for patients to speak. Personal protective equipment (PPE) makes it more difficult for patients to hear and understand what their caregivers are saying. It is critical to both diagnosis and to determining the impact of an intervention that a patient be able to communicate about pain and other symptoms. Likewise, it is critical that providers are able to effectively communicate in order to make a patient understand the condition, the intervention being recommended and what actions the patient should take. To make matters worse the current restrictions on visitors have also removed the support that family members and friends can provide. This forces patients to have to cope in isolation and adds to the burdens on their healthcare providers. All of this is even a greater challenge when providing care for patients with limited proficiency in the language spoken by their care providers.\n",
      " \n",
      "Being in the ICU and on a ventilator produces significant stress and has been identified as a cause of post-ICU stress disorder syndrome akin to the PTSD seen in combat veterans. The stress on nurses and other healthcare providers who are caring for ICU patients has been well documented and has certainly been amplified by the added risks associated with treating patients with COVID19.\n",
      " \n",
      "Meeting the challenge of overcoming communication barriers in this time of Covid19 is not necessarily going to require complex technology or a new skill set. We can learn from the best practices implemented in hospitals around the world. Speech-language pathologists (SLP) working in hospital settings have for years been providing a range of communication tools and strategies that have enabled critically ill patients to communicate and to more effectively participate in their care and in medical decision making. I have been working with a group of SLPs and other health providers around the country to put together a set of materials that can be freely downloaded and used in the ICUs to support patient-provider communication (www.patientprovidercommunication.org ). Since the Patient Provider Communication site has gone live, it has had over 57,,000-page views by individuals across the U.S. from 107 countries around the world.\n",
      " \n",
      "No patient hospitalized with Covid19 should be cut off from effectively communicating with their caregivers. Simple communication tools will help patients and their caregivers overcome the physical and psychological stress we are hearing about every day as our healthcare system is severely challenged by the Covid19 pandemic. \n",

      "In healthcare, innovative and lifesaving technology is unavoidable—it’s seemingly everywhere. Patient-provider technology is rapidly evolving into a seamless communication stream that connects patient with caregiver, establishing unrelenting ‘big data’ for clinical decision support.  EHR systems such as Cerner and Epic, robots that perform surgery, smart and wireless IV pumps and even robots roaming the hallways of our hospitals delivering food and supplies! How could there possibly be a patient, or even worse still, a group of the most vulnerable patients in our hospitals that are not well-served by technology? How is it possible that a group of patients is completely let down and shunned by lack of innovation? Why were these patients and the caregivers that provide for them left behind in the technological revolution designed to improve entire healthcare populations?\n",
      "Let’s take a minute to examine the details and the scope of this seemingly unbelievable situation. In our nation’s hospitals, roughly 3.9 million patients per year end up in our ICU’s in a non-verbal, non-mobile state1. These patients cannot summon a caregiver, and even if they could – they couldn’t communicate with their caregiver to explain why they’re reaching out to them. These non-verbal patients are at a three times greater risk of a preventable adverse event than patients that can communicate with their caregivers2. This issue costs our hospitals nearly $29 billion per year. Several studies examining patient-provider communication have indicated that the quality of the communication played a significant role in medical outcomes and in both patient and caregiver satisfaction3-6.\n",
      "Current hospital-based solutions used to communicate with non-verbal, non-mobile patients is straight out of the 18th century. However, there is no one to blame here–this is not hospital leadership’s fault. Why? Because hospital providers are using what is most readily available to them: lip-reading, patient scribbling, laminated paper-based communications boards, etc. Technology born of last century.\n",
      "\n",
      "If patient empowerment is truly the future of healthcare—how do we include the non-verbal, non-communicative patient in this promising future if current standard communication protocols in our nation’s hospitals leave them feeling frustrated, forgotten and without a voice? Voxello has a solution that brings these patients into the 21st century of patient empowerment and communication directly impacting patient outcomes and provider stress with the noddle® technology that literally gives these patients a voice and empowers them to be active participants in their own care.  \n",
      " \n",
      "On average every year hospitalized patients in the US experience almost 3 million preventable adverse events such as adverse drug reactions, falls, pressure ulcers and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The total cost to the US health system of treating these adverse events is in excess of $29 billion. Due to the regulatory shift towards quality and accountability, these are costs that hospitals must absorb. Hospital barriers to communication and poor patient-provider communication put individuals at increased risk of experiencing preventable adverse medical outcomes and unnecessary additional staff and patient stress.\n",
      " \n",
      "To address the communication needs of the widest range of patients, Voxello continues to develop technology to support patients who face both physical and cognitive barriers to effective communication. Individuals who have limited physical abilities are often unable to effectively summon help and communicate with caregivers. How do you communicate a potential adverse reaction to a medication if you cannot speak or move? Voxello addresses these communication barriers and by doing so hospitals can potentially save capital dollars by reducing their adverse event rates. Effective patient-provider communication reduces both patient and staff stress and can significantly move the needle on patient satisfaction. Improving patient-provider communication is at the core of the Voxello mission.\n",
      " \n",
      "See our recently published analysis of the cost of communication barriers (Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups,  SIG 12, Vol. 3(Part 3), 2018).\n",
      " \n",
      "It’s no secret that patients who are cognitively impaired or who have Alzheimer’s or Alzheimer’s related dementias have a great deal of difficulty communicating with caregivers. They have difficulty in understanding what they are being told and may also be unable to effectively let caregivers know how they are feeling and what their needs are.\n",
      "Hospitalizations can be very challenging for patients with dementia because of the change in environment as well as the change in daily activity schedule due to the medical interventions. These patients’ chronic difficulties with word finding, short-term memory and attention, that impact their ability to speak and to comprehend can become significantly greater as a function of increased stress and disorientation associated with their hospitalization. This makes it more difficult for them to effectively communicate with their nurses and other healthcare providers, rendering them more susceptible to preventable adverse events and delirium. Their inability to effectively communicate about their needs also contributes to their increased agitation and non-compliant behaviors, which in turn requires increased use of sedation and increased risk of delirium.\n",
      " \n",
      "Voxello has received an additional grant from the National Institute of Nursing Research (NIH) to expand their noddle-chat platform (communication software that enables patients with significant communication barriers the ability to actively engage with a  provider) so that it can also be used to support the communication needs of patients with Alzheimer’s Dementia and other patients who are cognitively impaired.\n",
      " \n",
      "Voxello and its clinical partners will be at ATIA in 2019 and will have two presentations on the docket.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first will highlight Voxello’s newest sensor, the min-mo (patent pending). Voxello, with support from the NIH-NINR, has developed the min-mo sensor that uses motion-sensing technology to detect a wide range of small intentional gestures (e.g. head nod, shoulder shrug, wrist roll). It can be used in a plug-and-play mode or can learn to recognize a patient’s particular gesture. The sensor is designed to be directly mounted to the patient so that patients can, regardless of their position in bed, be able to use the noddle to activate the nurse call system and control the noddle-chat communication tablet with speech generation. With the addition of this sensor, Voxello has expanded the range of patients that can more effectively summon their nurses providing greatly enhanced communication and participation in their care.\n",
      " \n",
      "The second presentation showcases a series of case studies at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics following implementation of the noddle® and the noddle-chat communication device for patients with complex communication needs.  While the use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies with outpatient populations is well established, it is not yet the standard of care for patients facing acute barriers to communication during a hospitalization. The presentation will describe the system barriers that must be overcome to incorporate AAC technology into clinical practice.  The presented cases will highlight the need for interprofessional practice and describe the implementation strategies and ongoing problem-solving needed to meet the communication needs of hospitalized patients.\n",
      " \n",
      "You can also see the latest Voxello technology at the ATIA conference. \n",
      " Voxello’s first publication indicating the economic impact of communication barriers in hospitals has been accepted by the American Speech and Hearing Association (ASHA). The publication emphasizes the importance of creating effective communication channels for patients that cannot speak or use common nurse call systems due to their conditions. The results of creating effective communications paths for this vulnerable patient population leading to profound outcomes on reducing preventable adverse events and creating cost savings for hospitals of $6.8 billion each year in the United States. You can read the abstract here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Voxello has released two new case studies highlighting the clinical and operational impact the noddle system is having at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC), a Level 1, 811-bed hospital. These case studies highlight the experiences of Matthew Howard, MD, Chair and DEO or Neurosurgery and Jolyn Schneider, BSN, RN PCCN, Intensive and Specialty Services, Burn/Trauma Center at UIHC. \n",
      "“The noddle helps us to provide a higher standard of care. It decreases the patient’s frustration with not being able to communicate with us effectively. I believe use of the noddle makes a patient feel that UIHC is doing the best it can to provide them quality care,” says Jolyn.\n",

      "How long does it take to recover from stroke? To help answer this popular question, we created a stroke recovery timeline using clinical studies and other patterns generally accepted by therapists.\n",
      "This timeline covers everything from the first 3 months to years after stroke. Let’s start at the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Every stroke is different, so every recovery will be different. The following stroke recovery timeline is an estimate of how events unfold.\n",
      "The early stages are more predictable than the later stages. Here’s what often occurs during the stroke recovery process:\n",
      "\n",
      "Day 1\n",
      "A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the supply of blood in the brain becomes compromised. When someone experiences a stroke, it’s important to seek fast, immediate medical attention. Time lost is brain lost.\n",
      "Day 2\n",
      "Once the stroke has been treated, rehabilitation begins on day one of the stroke recovery process. This often means starting rehab right from the hospital bed.\n",
      "Rehabilitation starts quickly to take advantage of the brain’s heightened state of neuroplasticity.\n",
      "You will see the fastest improvements immediately after injury because the brain is rapidly forming new neural connections to recover from the damage.\n",
      "Week 1\n",
      "Those who suffered minor strokes are often discharged within the first week. \n",
      "Massive stroke survivors may take longer to get discharged as they require more intensive care.\n",
      "If stroke side effects are severe and patients require a ventilator or feeding tube, they may be transferred to an acute care hospital.\n",
      "Week 2\n",
      "Half of patients experience the fastest recovery in the first two weeks, resulting in 50% recovery at this time, according to Journal of Neurology.\n",
      "This rapid recovery during the first two weeks is why most therapists work with patients intensively during this time.\n",
      "First 3 Months\n",
      "After the first 3 months of stroke recovery, your improvements may slow down due to the plateau effect after stroke.\n",
      "At this point, most inpatient rehab facilities will discharge you to continue recovery at home. The good news is that you can keep recovering with focused effort.\n",
      "While recovery might not occur as quickly, it can continue with a good physical therapy regimen at home.\n",
      "After the first 3 months, recovery starts to greatly vary from person to person. It’s impossible to create a stroke recovery timeline that applies to everyone.\n",
      "However, there are still some patterns worth noting. If you’re wondering how long it takes to recover from stroke, it helps to pay attention to these patterns.\n",
      "Here’s how the stroke recovery process may continue to unfold:\n",
      "4 Months\n",
      "After discharge from inpatient rehab, you will begin outpatient rehab, where you travel to and from the clinic for physical and occupational therapy.\n",
      "During these visits, you will work alongside trained therapists to continue rehabilitating your stroke side effects.\n",
      "At this point in your stroke recovery timeline, developing an effective stroke rehabilitation regimen at home is critical to your success.\n",
      "6 Months\n",
      "Your manner of walking (also known as your gait) is a major obstacle that some stroke survivors must overcome.\n",
      "About 65-85% of stroke patients will learn to walk independently after 6 months of rehabilitation.\n",
      "Those recovering from massive stroke may take longer, and we will get to that soon.\n",
      "1 Year\n",
      "The stroke recovery timeline after one year greatly varies from patient to patient.\n",
      "Those who sustained minor strokes may be fully recovered after 1 year while massive stroke survivors may be in the middle of rehabilitation.\n",
      "Individuals with aphasia may have fully recovered their speech at the 1-year mark, if speech therapy was aggressive.\n",
      "2 Years\n",
      "At the 2 year mark, many patients have regained mobility on their affected side, except for the extremities (hands and feet).\n",
      "Extremities are often the slowest to improve after stroke, but you can improve them with focused effort. Clinically proven technology like Flint Rehab’s MusicGlove make this more likely.\n",
      "Patients recovering from massive stroke may still have severe impairments on their affected side, but some movement may have returned at this point, especially with daily rehabilitation.\n",
      "Also, of the stroke patients that could not walk without assistance at the 6 month mark, 74% should be able to walk by the 2 year mark. This is a good reason to keep pushing for recovery even if results are slow.\n",
      "10 Years\n",
      "Most stroke survivors will achieve independence at the 10-year mark. However, some patients may have neglected rehabilitation during the early stages.\n",
      "When recovery has been neglected, there is still hope, even a decade after stroke. Plenty of research shows that aging adults can still engage neuroplasticity through rigorous training programs.\n",
      "Although the brain is not in a heightened state of plasticity anymore, recovery is still possible at any stage after stroke.\n",
      "Now that you understand how your stroke recovery timeline might unfold, let’s discuss ways to make it better.\n",
      "Here are our best tips to speed up recovery from stroke:\n",
      "To conclude our stroke recovery timeline, here’s an important reminder:\n",
      "No matter how long it has been since your stroke, there is always hope for recovery. \n",
      "Even if you have stopped rehabilitation for 20 years, you can always pick things back up and start recovering again. Keep going.\n",

      "Are you using colostrum for oral care in your NICU? There are several studies now related to this procedure.\n",
      "First, this started as a measure to reduce ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) because adult practices to avoid VAP required regular oral care with an antibacterial solution. NICU clinicians did not feel this solution would be safe in neonates, and in fact, were concerned that it may result in over-growth of pathogenic bacteria.\n",
      "As a result, colostrum was used as an alternative. It was known that this was safe to put into the infant’s mouth and contained probiotics, immunologics, and commensal bacteria. The procedure has never been studied in relation to VAP prevention, although it is part of many “bundles” to avoid VAP.\n",
      "However, there are now some rather sophisticated studies about early oral colostrum or breast milk administration and the effect on immunity. The administration of colostrum orally was recently shown to change the microbiota in the mouth when compared to oral care with sterile water.1 This difference continued for at least 48 hours.\n",
      "Oral care considerations\n",
      "For a different perspective to the administration of colostrum, consider this:\n",
      "And another perspective on the administration of colostrum: Nancy Rodriguez, PhD, spoke at the recent NANN conference and suggested that we call this “immune therapy” rather than oral care.2 Oral care simply implies we are removing debris from the mouth. The intent and evidence suggests we are, and should, be doing much more than this.\n",
      "Dr. Rodriguez’s studies required the drops of colostrum or breast milk be given via syringe into the buccal mucosa, and then swabbed around the area. The swabbing was done with a special foam applicator that did not result in cotton fibers being left in the oral cavity.\n",
      "Other researchers³ have put tracers on the lactoferrin in the milk applied in this manner and measured the same lactoferrin with tracers in the urine, showing that these are absorbed through the oral mucosa. Indeed, this and immunoglobulins in the milk provide additional immune protection to the infant when they would normally be getting this from the amniotic fluid. While this was a small study and more study is needed, infants who received colostrum orally did have a lower rate of clinical sepsis.3\n",
      "Therefore, evidence exists that human milk should be administered in this way in even the smallest babies, and is perhaps more important for them, and continued until they are able to take feedings by mouth. When feedings are typically started for these infants, they are given via feeding tube that bypasses the oral cavity and back of the throat where amniotic fluid would normally provide nutrients and immunologic properties until term birth.\n",
      "While the use of breast milk for VAP prevention eludes evidence, this is partly due to the difficulty in diagnosing VAP. Furthermore, the evidence we have to date shows that all premature infants should benefit from this procedure, and not just those who are intubated and at risk for VAP.\n",

Indications seeking surgical directing embody uncontrollable hypertension, schism, or involvement of a larger aortic diverge with following end-organ ischemia. Aortic Aneurysm 2 Epidemiology/Pathophysiology Aneurysms are defined as dilatation of an aortic part >3 cm. While miniature aneurysms may bursting, the imperil of breach increases dramatically as aneurysms broaden to >5cm. Middle-aged patients presenting with abdominal or border pain in the arse should every time bear the diagnosis entertained. The location and calibre of headache is variable, most commonly presenting as severe, critical abdominal, shy away from, or outmanoeuvre tribulation. Calcification of the aortic wall can be seen with palpable en- largement of the aorta. It is very supersensitive and can determine the enormousness of an aneurysm as understandably as connect intraperitoneal loose running indicative of fracture. Bedside ultrasound can be done rapidly, making it peculiarly useful for the benefit of unstable patients. Drawbacks of ultrasound comprehend operator-dependent correctness and dilemma in visualization of the aorta in patients with overkill debauchery bowel gas or obesity. Asymptomatic aneurysms discovered during fleshly exam or during evaluation in place of other problems may be re- ferred in compensation moreover reckoning and treatment. Opinion includes visualization of the aorta and anticoagula- tion and restore as demanded. Many patients with aorto-enteric fistulae also have septic complications necessitating antibiotics. The clinical challenges of abdominal aortic aneurysm: Rapid, system- atic detection and outcome-effective management. Sokolove Focal Anatomy and Physiology The trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles are the conducting airways and consist of a series of branching tubes that mature narrower and shorter as they suffuse into the lungs. These airway structures have no diffusion perceptiveness and set forth about 150 ml of lung mass. Eventually the terminal bronchioles restraint to the alveoli that figure the verified gas-exchange interface. Con- striction is also reflexive and may be initiated beside irritants, temperature, and psychogenic causes. Expiration is a unshaken technique that occurs as the bouncy lung combination returns to its preinspiratory bulk. Diagnosis Dyspnea is the most conventional symptom and is almost widespread in get up patients. Valuable increases in work of breathing indi- cate fierce or in the air respiratory remissness. Agonal respirations are slow, frivolous breaths that tag in the cards respiratory retard. Chaos, som- nolence and shaking may turn up dawn on supportive to hypoxia and/or hypercarbia. The company of decreased mentation in patients with respiratory harry indicates the need for immediate intervention. Tachypnea occurs secondary to stimulation of primary respiratory centers in patients with hypoxia or hypercarbia. Hypopnea results from stimulant inges- tion, stroke, seizures, hypothyroidism, and other causes of impaired brainstem charge. Inspiratory stridor is classically seen with supra- glottic obstacle and expiratory stridor with subglottic pathology. Bronchspasm is the most common motive but other etiologies include inappropriate body and pulmonary edema. Some patients with bronchospasm or airway cessation may be experiencing undersized or no wheezing if airflow is sternly reduced. Pitch-dark hardy b cold review, unnecessary vascular infection, hypoperfusion, and anemia may call falsely depressed readings. Findings are habitually practical suitable credentials of the underlying well-spring and may own treatment implications. Anyway, the verdict to intubate or adminis- ter other airway interventions is about each time based on clinical, sort of than radio- well-defined criteria. Treatment Supplemental oxygen increases the delivered FiO2 with each liter of oxygen increasing FiO2 by means of approaching 4%. Divers transportation devices are nearby but nasal cannulae and masks are the most commonly reach-me-down. Nasal cannula may be habituated to inasmuch as patients with serene hypoxia but is not apt in the backdrop of crude respiratory distress. The incalculable womanhood of patients who last will and testament misfire treatment do so within the pre-eminent 12 h. In commitment to be a nominee, a long-suffering essential entertain a unblemished sensorium, be qualified to enter upon breaths, and be expert to abide the shroud. A de- tailed discussion of ventilator running is beyond the stretch of this quotation. This might include medical treatment, surgical intervention, and/or definite ventilator strategies. Part B: Asthma Asthma is a lingering infection characterized sooner than increased airway responsiveness to various stimuli. This causes widespread narrowing of the slash airways that reverses either spontaneously or with treatment. Although the faithful pathophysiology of asthma is complex and unprofessionally given, redness is cerebration to portray a middle character.\n",

      "A 37 year-old, 600-pound woman was admitted to an acute care medical center after developing necrotizing fasciitis as a complication of a chronic group A streptococcus panniculus infection. The patient developed septic shock — multi-organ system failure — requiring ventilation, dialysis and hemodynamic support. The patient underwent standard sepsis protocols. Serial debridement to control infection resulted in an open abdominal wound measuring 130 x 136 cm. Immediately prior to admission to a long term acute care hospital, a surgical team removed 100 pounds of excess pannus and employed vertical retention sutures to attempt closure of all but 56 cm of the wound. Two large surgical drains were placed along the wound gutter — each drain extending along the lower lip of the wound to the opposite end.\n",
      "Shortly after admission to the long term acute care hospital, the patient again became septic and was put back on a ventilator. The patient remained on ventilation throughout most of her stay at the long term acute care hospital.\n",
      "Figure 1A\n",
      "Figure 1B\n",
      "Figure 1C\n",
      "To promote moist wound healing, the team managed exudates by irrigating wound tunnels with normal saline, and controlled absorption by using Hydrofiber® Technology2 and alginate.\n",
      "Figure 2A\n",
      "Figure 2B\n",
      "On day 28, the wound care team removed the surgical drains, as they had become non-functional. The team initiated negative pressure wound therapy with simultaneous irrigation: The Cardinal Health™ SVED® device.\n",
      "They addressed the wound’s challenges as follows:\n",
      "The wound care team changed dressings twice a week. At each dressing change, the team incrementally pulled up the lower lip, securing it with Cardinal Health™ Black Foam. The goal was to align the bottom wound edge with the top, in order to achieve adhesion.\n",
      "Initial assessments showed a reduction in drainage. Subsequent assessments revealed adhesion of the previously open suture line, as well as tunneling closure. By the end of this period, the wound displayed 100 percent granulation, with completely viable wound edges. This was particularly remarkable because the patient remained on a ventilator throughout the treatment—typically a poor prognosis for wound healing.\n",
      "Using negative pressure wound therapy with simultaneous irrigation, the team was delighted to achieve healing success.\n",
      "Figure 3\n",
      "Final closure was performed on-site by the wound care team (advanced practice nurses under the supervision of the team’s physician). Although the wound would have closed without any suturing, this uncomplicated procedure made the patient a better candidate for placement in a long term acute care facility.\n",
      "Figure 4\n",
      "Shortly after this final picture was taken, the patient was discharged to a long term care acute facility in order to treat the neurological complications of her sepsis.\n",
      "The massive damage caused by necrotizing fasciitis is a notoriously difficult medical challenge. In this instance, tissue loss and systemic shock were exacerbated by morbid obesity. The patient’s ongoing respiratory issues — requiring her continual use of a ventilator — further complicated recovery.\n",
      "To handle this complex case, the wound care team chose the Cardinal Health™ NPWT system — the only available technology that can deliver two modalities in a single unit: negative pressure wound therapy and simultaneous irrigation. Managed from its console, the SVED® device delivered both therapies concurrently. This freed the wound care team from the time consuming and leakage-prone routine of having to swap devices, alternate therapies and reattach tubing.\n",
      "Low-residue Cardinal Health™ Black Foam Dressings optimized negative pressure wound therapy drainage.

      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the production and use of a low-cost ventilator that University of Minnesota researchers developed, with support from MGC Diagnostics, Digi-Key, Protolabs, and Teknic, Inc\n",
      "With this FDA approval, the ventilator, named Coventor, is able to begin production and distribution to health care systems in need. According to the news release, the Coventor was designed as a low-cost backup alternative for physicians to use during treatment for COVID-19. As ventilators are limited nationwide, hospitals need a way to support patients with pneumonia and respiratory distress.\n",
      "Stephen Richardson, a cardiac anesthesiology fellow in the Medical School, M Health Fairview said, “Our hope is that the Coventor will be useful in those clinical settings where traditional ventilators are not available. With FDA authorization, we are closer to that happening.”\n",
      "The Coventor prototype was made using “off-the-shelf” components. With a compact size, simplicity, and cost the device will be relatively inexpensive to manufacture and distribute. The Coventor is the first ventilator of it’s kind and features a custom slider-crank mechanism, which allows medical staff to control how oxygen is delivered to patients. \n",
      "Coventor's design will be made open source, which will allow other manufacturers around the world to begin regulatory and production processes.\n",
      "“This allows patients who wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity to survive, to survive,” Richardson said. “The Coventor gives people a chance and that is what this is all about. Making the ventilator as fast as possible, pushing it to people everywhere.”\n",

Pediatrix Medical Group of Texas – San Antonio has been caring for newborns for more than 30 years. Through our hospital partners, we provide comprehensive clinical services to support the most critically-ill and premature newborns. Currently, our practice cares for more than 225 newborns each day in multiple neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).\n",
      "Our neonatologists and NNPs are available on-site in the NICU. They are on call 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a- week. The NICU is a special nursery dedicated to taking care of sick newborns. Babies who require special care in the NICU have problems ranging from minor to serious. Some babies may stay only hours, while others may stay for months before they are ready to go home. Your baby’s physician will determine his or her length of stay depending on the care needed.\n",

      "A neonatologist is a pediatrician with special training in caring for babies that are sick and require intensive care after birth. Neonatologists coordinate the care for the majority of babies in the NICU. At times, the neonatologist might consult with other specialists to help with your baby’s care. Although there are many different people involved in your baby’s care while in the NICU, it is the neonatologist who determines and coordinates the daily plan of care.\n",
      "Neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) are neonatal nurses who have obtained a graduate degree (or certificate) with emphasis in caring for the needs of critically-ill newborns and their families. The NNP works in collaboration with a neonatologist to diagnose and treat babies. The NNP also performs procedures to aid in the diagnosis (e.g., spinal taps) and management (e.g., chest tube placement) of medical conditions.\n",

      "A developmental pediatrician is a specialist within the field of developmental pediatrics, which has been a subspecialty of pediatrics for more than 20 years. This field overlaps with many other areas of pediatrics including neurology, psychiatry, psychology, physical medicine and general pediatrics. Developmental pediatricians frequently manage or evaluate conditions which are considered developmental disabilities, but the field also encompasses ways of preventing some of the impact these disabilities may have on the child and their family.\n",

      "2015 Neonatology Survey:Top Concerns When Managing an Intubated Infant\n",
      "Respondents were allowed to mark more than one answer to each question\n",
      "In fact, 86% of neonatologists are dissatisfied with current endotracheal tube solutions, according to a 2015 Neonatology Survey. There are also enormous clinical, financial and emotional components that complicate the issue and impact not only the hospital and its staff, but the patient and family, too.\n",
      "Each year, approximately 60 million intubations requiring endotracheal tubes are performed worldwide. Assuring proper placement of the endotracheal tube within the trachea and assuring that it hasn’t moved into a dangerous location or become obstructed are significant clinical problems. Failure to correct a misplaced or clogged endotracheal tube can lead to serious complications, most notably high-risk conditions consistent with lack of oxygen such as brain damage or death.\n",
      "Common intubation issues include:\n",
      "AirWave uses sound technology similar to sonar called acoustic reflectometry with innovative piezoelectric technology to monitor the patient’s airway, alerting clinicians in real time of situations that may lead to unplanned extubations, endotracheal tube obstructions, endobronchial intubation, or esophageal intubation.\n",

      "AirWave uses sound technology similar to sonar called acoustic reflectometry with innovative piezoelectric technology to monitor the patient’s airway, alerting clinicians in real time of situations that may lead to unplanned extubations, endotracheal tube obstructions, endobronchial intubation, or esophageal intubation.\n",
      "Using principles similar to sonar, the SonarMed® AirWave™ Monitoring System sends a sound signal into the endotracheal tube and records the returning echoes that reverberate within the tube and patient airways. The timing and amplitude of these echoes are analyzed by the system to non-invasively measure:\n",
      "The system analyzes the echo that comes from the tube tip to estimate the size of the passageway relative to tube diameter. This information helps clinicians identify and correct esophageal intubation and endobronchial intubation.\n",
      "The system analyzes the timing and amplitude of echoes that come from within the tube to estimate the location and size of obstructions. This information helps clinicians identify an obstruction that forms in the endotracheal tube so it can be removed (suctioned) before the patient is harmed. It may also help the clinician differentiate tube kinking from lung secretion buildup by determining the location of the obstruction. Suctioning to remove obstructions is invasive and can result in serious physical conditions, such as infection and retinopathy caused by damaged blood vessels, and psychological effects such as ischemic brain injury due to hypoxemia (abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood) and hypercarbia (abnormally elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood). If an obstruction is not cleared, it can cause brain damage, breathing failure, and death. The ability to confidently know the tube is clear of secretions helps clinicians best care for their patients.\n",
      "The system identifies movements of the tip of the tube by tracking the timing of an echo that comes from within the lungs. This information helps clinicians identify and correct situations that can lead to unplanned extubation or endobronchial intubation.\n",
      "The AirWave monitor is a handheld, portable device with a color LCD display that provides information about the endotracheal tube position, obstruction, and movement. The monitor has sophisticated circuitry for sending, receiving and processing audio signals from the AirWave sensor.  SonarMed’s proprietary algorithms interpret the signals received from the patient’s airway and provide feedback to the clinician through intuitive text and graphics.\n",
      "The AirWave sensor is a small, latex-free, single-patient use disposable device that inserts into the breathing circuit between the ventilator hose and the endotracheal tube. The AirWave sensor contains an array of acoustic sensors (speaker and a microphone array) used for interrogating the artificial airway and communicates with the AirWave monitor through a cable. The AirWave sensor can be connected to endotracheal tube sizes 2.5 to 9.0 mm.\n",
      "Swivel & tilt mounting bracket to provide flexibility for positioning the monitor near the patient bedside. The bracket is designed to quickly attach to the back of the AirWave monitor. It allows the monitor to be mounted to a round pole (such as an IV stand), or a rectangular rail (such as those found on many ventilators). The bracket also rotates easily between vertical and horizontal orientations, and allows the monitor to be positioned to an optimum viewing angle.\n",
      "Mounting pole to provide even more options for placing it at the patient bedside or attaching to a ventilator.\n",
      "Hanging strap for carrying or hanging the unit and a kickstand for propping the unit on a cart or table.\n",
      "The AirWave easily integrates with standard equipment in hospital ICU/NICU/PICUs, operating rooms, and emergency departments, including all major mechanical ventilation systems, any brand of endotracheal tube, in-line suction catheters, flow sensors and ETC02.\n",
      "AirWave has been evaluated in several studies, demonstrating efficacy in providing direct, precise, real-time monitoring of endotracheal tube position, movement and obstructions.\n",
      "AirWave received U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance in 2010 for indication in adults and in 2016 for neonate (pediatric) patients.\n",

      "Corona Update: SURGE CAPACITY SOLUTIONS – The mobi is a mobile headwall (equipment consolidator) that can be set up in any space that has an electrical outlet: next to a chair, a bed, a cot in a hallway, a cafeteria, or anywhere patients need to be located. Click here for more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an age-old axiom that you need to move to live. mobigo ICU patient ambulation promotes safe early patient mobility and has been clinically validated to reduce length of stay in the ICU by 20-30%. mobigo will increase staff productivity and help reduce many adverse patient outcomes including ICU delirium and secondary infections.\n",
      "With the mobi, a hospital can manage daily overflow as well as disaster situations which create an unpredicted surge in demand. The mobi provides a flexible, proactive, and customizable surge solution. The mobi can be deployed as an emergency department bay on wheels in full compliance with The Joint Commission’s patient safety standards. With a floor footprint the size of a common IV pole, it can consolidate equipment, supplies, and oxygen for up to two critical patients. Its ability to extend existing headwalls has made it the most cost-effective way for a hospital to increase its surge capacity by 10-20%. Hospitals can manage overflow in the Emergency Department, upgrade a Med/Surg room to ICU-level capability, and flex their capacity without adding onto the building. It all becomes possible with the mobi.\n",
      "“6 months ago we implemented 12 mobis into our early mobility program. We have a very diverse population on our ICU and having the option of mobilizing them in a way that is helpful and assistive to staff while instilling confidence in the patient and family is great. We’re still working to figure out our ideal workflow but it’s given us concrete examples of how even our sicker vented patients can get mobilized safely and efficiently.”\n",
      "“After completing a research study with the LIVENGOOD mobi on our post trauma/surgical floor, I realized its potential to decrease length of stay, help with staff efficiency and empower patients to be independent.”\n",
      "“We are so excited that the mobi helped us ambulate our very first vented patient.”\n",
      "“The LIVENGOOD mobi is very user friendly, safe and a great solution to use minimal staff and be able to contain all of the patient’s equipment.”\n",
      "“I think the LIVENGOOD mobi will revolutionize the way we mobilize patients in the ICU. I saw patients mobilize sooner and with less anxiety with the mobi. One young patient was even able to walk outside with the mobi and her portable vent. Having the mobi made mobility a real team effort, not just a P.T. activity.”\n",
      "“The LIVENGOOD platform allows my patients to be active and independent without attention being diverted to multiple lines, an oxygen tank, and other medically necessary devices. It allows patients to have hope and a sense of “normalcy”, which so often is lost after trauma or surgery.”\n",
      "“Six years ago I was introduced to the LIVENGOOD mobi. This piece of equipment has been life changing for my patients. I am now able to consolidate all of the patient’s medical devices onto an easy to push mobile platform, therefore freeing up both of my hands to safely assist my patient.”\n",
      "“Mobility is Life, the mobi platform will help patients move again.”\n",
      "“I was at NTI in Boston (2013) and, during the exhibit portion, I wandered across the LIVENGOOD booth. At that moment, I knew our hospital needed this mobi for our open heart recovery program. I worked with a Clinical Nurse Specialist to write a grant for this product. I am so excited to bring the mobi to our program.”\n",
      "“We walked a vented patient with the mobi and it was awesome! This helped her physically and emotionally.”\n",
      "“I am a nurse in a cardiovascular ICU… Our goal for patients is to ambulate to the chair 2 hours after extubation, often the evening of surgery day. Our patients are up and walking with central venous catheters, swan ganz catheters, chest tubes, foley catheters, and with IV medications infusing. The ambulation of these patients would not be possible without the mobi walker. Every bit of equipment that these patients need can be carried on the walker while providing the stability of a standard walker… It is an essential piece of equipment for us and we couldn’t provide the care and therapies we do without it.”\n",
      "Keeping the object stable during the scan is one of the crucial requirements to obtain images without movement artifacts. However, when scanning the chest area of live animals this is of course not possible. In order to compensate for movement artifacts using synchronization strategies, care must be taken to optimize the anesthesia, resulting in a continuous breathing pattern throughout the scan.Synchronizing image acquisition with breathing movement can be done in two ways: pro-spective and retro-spective synchronization. Both types of synchronization are possible with the SkyScan in vivo scanners. When aiming for the optimal image quality, a pro-spective synchronized scan, combined with intubating the animals and ventilating them using a small animal ventilator will result in optimal stability of the chest during image acquisition. Although this will result in the best image quality, it is also an invasive and time consuming procedure.\n",
      "As an alternative, retro-spective synchronization can be applied. This  synchronization strategy acquires multiple projection images at every  rotation step. In addition, a time stamp of both the breathing pattern  and the image acquisition is logged, allowing a post-scan sorting of the  images into a number of bins in which the breathing cycle is divided.  The advantage of the retro-spective synchronization is that it  compensates for irregular breathing patterns throughout the scan. The  output is a 4-dimensional dataset: 3D at multiple phases of the  breathing pattern, allowing functional analysis of lung parameters such  as tidal volume, and functional residual capacity. The method note \"MN005_Lung analysis in vivo after synchronized scanning\" describes in  detail the scanning parameters, the sorting of the data into the  different phases of the breathing cycle and a step by step analysis of  the datasets resulting in the quantitative result of the air volume in  the lungs at different phases of the breathing cycle.\n",
